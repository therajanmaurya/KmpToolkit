/**
 * The wasmWasi URL channel.
 *
 * WASI has no display and no browser — but "open this URL" is a *request*, and a WASI module can
 * always pass a request to the host that embedded it. A CLI host might print the link, a server
 * host might enqueue it, a desktop embedder might hand it to the real OS. So rather than returning
 * `false` and dropping it, the request crosses the boundary.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * WasiUrlOpener.handler = { url, hint -> myHost.openInSystemBrowser(url); true }
 * ```
 *
 * With no handler the URL is buffered in [opened] and echoed to stdout, so a host that only reads
 * process output still receives it — which is why [canOpen] is true by default rather than false.
