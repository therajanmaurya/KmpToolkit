/**
 * watchOS URL opening via `WKExtension.openSystemURL`.
 *
 * ## What changed and why
 * These four functions used to return `false` / `NoHandler` unconditionally, above a comment
 * reading "watchOS has no browser or URL-opening concept". The sibling `cmp-intent-launcher`
 * module has been using `WKExtension.sharedExtension.openSystemURL` on watchOS all along — the
 * claim was simply wrong, and this module's users got nothing as a result.
 *
 * watchOS routes a fixed set of schemes: `http`/`https` hand off to the paired iPhone, while
 * `tel:`, `sms:` and `mailto:` are handled on the watch itself. Anything else has no handler, and
 * [canOpen] says so up front rather than after a silent failure.
