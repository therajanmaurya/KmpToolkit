package com.mobilebytelabs.kmptoolkit.clipboard

/*
 * Cross-platform clipboard utilities for Kotlin Multiplatform.
 *
 * Provides simple functions to interact with the system clipboard across
 * all supported platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, JVM, JS, Linux, and Windows.
 *
 * ## Zero Configuration
 *
 * No setup required! Just import and use:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * import com.mobilebytelabs.kmptoolkit.clipboard.copyToClipboard
 * import com.mobilebytelabs.kmptoolkit.clipboard.getFromClipboard
 *
 * // Copy text - works immediately on all platforms
 * copyToClipboard("Hello, World!")
 *
 * // Read text (where supported)
 * val text = getFromClipboard()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Platform Support
 *
 * | Platform | Copy | Read | Notes |
 * |----------|:----:|:----:|-------|
 * | Android  | ✅   | ✅   | Auto-initialized via ContentProvider |
 * | iOS      | ✅   | ✅   | Full support |
 * | macOS    | ✅   | ✅   | Full support |
 * | tvOS     | ✅   | ✅   | Full support |
 * | watchOS  | ✅   | ✅   | Full support |
 * | JVM      | ✅   | ✅   | Uses AWT Toolkit |
 * | JS       | ✅   | ❌   | Async API, write-only for sync |
 * | Wasm JS  | ✅   | ❌   | Async API, write-only for sync |
 * | Linux    | ✅   | ✅   | Requires xclip or xsel |
 * | Windows  | ✅   | ✅   | Uses Win32 API |
 * | WASI     | ❌   | ❌   | No clipboard in WASI runtime |
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Copy text to clipboard
 * val success = copyToClipboard("Hello, World!")
 *
 * // Read text from clipboard (where supported)
 * val text = getFromClipboard()
 *
 * // Check if clipboard has text
 * if (hasClipboardText()) {
 *     println("Clipboard has content")
 * }
 *
 * // Clear clipboard
 * clearClipboard()
 * ```

/**
 * Copies the given text to the system clipboard.
 *
 * This function attempts to copy the provided text to the system clipboard.
 * The operation is synchronous on most platforms, but may be fire-and-forget
 * on JavaScript platforms due to async clipboard API limitations.
 *
 * @param text The text to copy to clipboard. Can be any valid string.
 * @return `true` if the copy operation was initiated successfully, `false` otherwise.
 *         Note: On JS platforms, this returns `true` when the operation is initiated,
 *         not when it completes.
 * @since 0.1.0
 *
 * @sample
 * ```kotlin
 * val success = copyToClipboard("Hello, Clipboard!")
 * if (success) {
 *     println("Text copied successfully")
 * }
 * ```

 * Reads text from the system clipboard.

 * or if reading is not supported on the current platform.
 *
 * @return The clipboard text content, or `null` if unavailable or unsupported.
 * @since 0.1.0
 *
 * @sample
 * ```kotlin
 * val clipboardText = getFromClipboard()

 *     println("Clipboard contains: $text")

/**
 * Checks if the clipboard contains text content.
 *
 * This function checks whether the system clipboard currently contains
 * text that can be read. Useful for enabling/disabling paste functionality
 * in UI applications.
 *
 * @return `true` if the clipboard contains text content, `false` otherwise.
 *         Returns `false` on platforms where clipboard reading is not supported.
 * @since 0.1.0
 *
 * @sample
 * ```kotlin
 * if (hasClipboardText()) {

/**
 * Copy and paste — the narrow, injectable surface a ViewModel actually depends on.
 *
 * ## Why this is smaller than [ClipboardManager]
 * [ClipboardManager] is a 40-member facade over monitoring, history, permissions and observation.
 * Almost no caller wants all of that: a ViewModel wants "copy this code", "read what is on the
 * clipboard". Depending on the whole manager to do that makes it unfakeable — the manager is a
 * concrete class whose primitives route straight to top-level `expect fun`s, so a test touches the
 * real system clipboard, which behaves differently on every CI runner.
 *
 * This interface is those primitives and nothing else. [ClipboardManager] implements it, so
 * existing wiring is unchanged, and `FakeClipboard` gives tests an isolated one.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class ReferralViewModel(private val clipboard: Clipboard) : ViewModel() {
 *     fun copyCode(code: String) {
 *         if (clipboard.copy(code)) showToast("Copied")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For monitoring, history or permissions, inject [ClipboardManager] instead — this is deliberately
 * the small half.
