Legend (Real impl): ✅ real impl, 🟡 partial / wontfix-OS / wontfix-infra / legacy stub, ⛔ not declared, — N/A.
Legend (Coverage enum, since 2026-06-01): `full` (all public-API methods backed by OS primitive) · `partial` (most real; some typed UnsupportedPlatform fallbacks for contracts that don't apply) · `wontfix-OS` (OS lacks the primitive) · `wontfix-infra` (impl possible but CI/toolchain blocks it) · `(legacy:full|stub)` (auto-derived; pre-opt-in modules — add a `// LD-2-coverage: {enum}` comment to the platform's primary `.kt` file to graduate). See `RULE-LIB-DEVELOPMENT-MD-001` LD-2 + ADRs for accepted wontfix cases.

## §5 Extension Recipes (authored — cmp-intent-share-coverage-trueup, 2026-06-01)

### Recipe: How a platform graduates from stub → partial → full

Same procedure as `cmp-intent-launcher` — see [cmp-intent-launcher DEVELOPMENT.md §5](../cmp-intent-launcher/DEVELOPMENT.md#5-extension-recipes-authored--cmp-intent-share-coverage-trueup-2026-06-01) for the canonical 7-step playbook. `cmp-share`-specific adaptations:

- **Step 2 template files:**
  - Android — `androidMain/Share.android.kt` (Intent.ACTION_SEND + FileProvider for binary; EXTRA_TEXT for text/url).
  - iOS — `iosMain/Share.ios.kt` (UIActivityViewController via `suspendCancellableCoroutine`; resolves top-most VC via traversal).
  - macOS — `macosMain/Share.macos.kt` (NSSharingServicePicker; `showRelativeToRect` on anchor view).
  - JVM — `jvmMain/Share.jvm.kt` (AWT clipboard + OS-dispatch chain via ProcessBuilder).
  - JS/wasmJs — `jsMain/Share.js.kt` / `wasmJsMain/Share.wasmJs.kt` (`navigator.share` Web Share API; Level-2 file support via `Blob` / `File` + `navigator.canShare({files})` feature-detect; falls back to clipboard).
  - Linux — `linuxMain/Share.linux.kt` (POSIX `fopen`+`fwrite` to `$TMPDIR/cmp-share-*` for Image; `xclip` for text; `xdg-open` for url/file).
  - mingw — `mingwMain/Share.mingw.kt` (Win32 `ShellExecuteW` for url; clipboard API for text; binary blocked — see ADR-001).
  - tvOS — `tvosMain/Share.tvos.kt` (optional consumer-provided `CmpShareTvosBridge.swift` probed via ObjC runtime — Text/Url only).
  - watchOS — `watchosMain/Share.watchos.kt` (`WCSession.transferUserInfo` for text/url; binary blocked by the arm32 bit-width split — see ADR-001). All five architectures are declared and build. NOTE: `watchosSimulatorArm64Test` cannot execute on a dev box with no watchOS simulator runtime installed (Xcode reports "does not support simulator tests for watchos_simulator_arm64"); execution happens in the `watchos` job of `.github/workflows/native-tests.yml`.
  - wasmWasi — `wasmWasiMain/Share.wasmWasi.kt` (every payload → `UnsupportedPlatform`; `ShareCapabilities.None`). Asserted by `wasmWasiTest/ShareWasmWasiTest.kt` so the declared-failure contract cannot silently become a no-op.

- **Step 5 contract tests:** mirror `FakeShareLauncher` + `ShareContractTest`. Verify your impl returns the same sealed-result types as the Fake's scripted results (`Completed` / `Cancelled` / `Failed(typed cause)`).

- **Step 7 ADR:** if your graduation reverses a row from [ADR-001](docs/ADR-001-tvos-no-share-watchos-arm32.md), supersede ADR-001 with a new ADR explaining what changed.

### Recipe: Add a capability to the manager facade

`ShareManager` is the injectable surface; `Share` is the engine. Adding to the facade:

1. Add the method to `ShareManager` **as an interface default** that routes to `share(payload, options)`.
   Keep `capabilities` and `share` the only abstract members — that is what makes a test double two
   lines, and `FakeShareManager` gets your new method for free.
2. If the method takes a message alongside a payload, bundle through the private `withMessage`
   helper rather than building a `SharePayload.Multi` at the call site — a blank message must not
   produce a bundle carrying an empty `Text` item.
3. If the new capability is not universal, add a field to `ShareCapabilities` and update **all nine**
   `ShareCapabilities.<platform>.kt` actuals. Do not guess a value: read that platform's
   `when (payload)` block and record what it really does.
4. Extend `supports()` for the new payload kind. For anything bundle-shaped, recurse — a bundle is
   supported only when bundling *and* every item is.
5. Test against `FakeShareManager` in `commonTest`, asserting the PAYLOAD the method builds. That
   mapping is the whole value of the facade and is where a regression goes unnoticed.
6. Refresh BCV: `./gradlew :cmp-share:apiDump`.

Compose-only surface (anything typed in `androidx.compose.*`) belongs in `cmp-share-compose`, not
here — the headless artifact ships to tvOS, Linux and Windows, which have no Compose at all.

### Recipe: Add a new SharePayload subtype

1. Add `public {data} class NewType(...) : SharePayload()` to `commonMain/Share.kt`.
2. Add a DSL convenience helper: `public suspend fun Share.newtype(...) = share(SharePayload.NewType(...))`.
3. Per-platform — extend each `Share.{platform}.kt`'s `when (payload)` block to handle the new subtype. Platforms that can't route the new payload return `Failed(UnsupportedPlatform)`.
4. Update the per-platform LD-2-coverage annotation if any platform's coverage degrades from `full` → `partial`.
5. Add a contract test exercising the new subtype against `FakeShareLauncher`.
6. Refresh BCV baseline: `./gradlew :cmp-share:apiDump`.

## §7 Cross-Platform Parity Recipes (authored — LLM-seeded)

### Pattern: Declared capability, never a silent no-op

**When to use:** whenever a capability is real on some targets and absent on others — which is the
normal case for anything touching the platform.

The failure mode this avoids: a UI renders a share button on tvOS, the user selects it, and nothing
happens (or it fails after they have already picked a target). The fix is to let callers ask BEFORE
they offer, and to make the answer come from the same place the behaviour does.

**Code shape** — an `expect val` descriptor, one `actual` per source set, plus a derived query:

```kotlin
// commonMain
public expect val platformShareCapabilities: ShareCapabilities

// tvosMain — reflects what Share.tvos.kt's `when (payload)` actually does
public actual val platformShareCapabilities: ShareCapabilities = ShareCapabilities.TextAndUrlOnly
```

```kotlin
// derived in commonMain — no extra actuals, and bundles recurse
public fun supports(payload: SharePayload): Boolean = when (payload) {
    is SharePayload.Multi -> capabilities.multi && payload.items.all { supports(it) }
    ...
}
```

**Rules that make it hold:**

- The descriptor is written by READING each `actual`, never assumed. Every value in
  `ShareCapabilities.<platform>.kt` carries a KDoc line saying why.
- `true` means *the implementation attempts it*, not *it will succeed*. Per-call outcomes stay in
  `ShareResult` — a browser without Web Share Level 2 still reports `NoHandler`.
- A capability that is false must return a typed `ShareError.UnsupportedPlatform`, never `Unit` and
  never a swallowed exception.
- The published README table is generated from the same facts, so documentation cannot drift from
  behaviour.

Applies unchanged to the other platform-facade modules — `cmp-intent-launcher`, `cmp-app-intents`,
`cmp-clipboard`, `cmp-in-app-update`.
