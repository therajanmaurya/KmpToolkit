/**
 * Injectable share entry point — the interface to depend on from a ViewModel, repository or
 * composable.
 *
 * ## Why an interface when [Share] already exists
 * [Share] is an `expect object`. An object cannot be substituted, so anything calling it directly
 * is untestable without launching a real share sheet, and cannot be swapped for an app-specific
 * decorator (analytics, consent checks, a queue). [ShareManager] is the same capability behind a
 * type you can inject, fake and wrap. [Share] remains public and unchanged for callers that want
 * the imperative form.
 *
 * ## Implementing
 * Only [capabilities] and [share] are abstract; every other member is derived from them. A test
 * double is therefore two lines:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class FakeShareManager(
 *     override val capabilities: ShareCapabilities = ShareCapabilities.Full,
 * ) : ShareManager {
 *     val shared = mutableListOf<SharePayload>()
 *     override suspend fun share(payload: SharePayload, options: ShareOptions): ShareResult {
 *         shared += payload
 *         return ShareResult.Completed
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Using
 * ```kotlin
 * class ReportViewModel(private val share: ShareManager) : ViewModel() {
 *     val canExport = share.capabilities.file
 *
 *     fun exportPdf(uri: String) = viewModelScope.launch {
 *         when (val result = share.shareFile(uri, "application/pdf", message = "Latest report")) {
 *             is ShareResult.Failed -> showError(result.cause)
 *             else -> Unit
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Every share method suspends: on most targets the sheet is presented and awaited, and the
 * returned [ShareResult] distinguishes completion from cancellation.
