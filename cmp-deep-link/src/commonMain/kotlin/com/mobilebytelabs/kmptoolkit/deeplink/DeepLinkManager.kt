/**
 * Injectable deep-link intake — the type to depend on from a ViewModel or navigation coordinator.
 *
 * ## Why an interface when [DeepLinkHandler] already exists
 * [DeepLinkHandler] is a process-wide `object`, which is the right shape for it: OS callbacks
 * arrive with no reference to your object graph, so intake has to be reachable from anywhere.
 * That same property makes it awkward to test — an `object` cannot be substituted, and state
 * leaks between test cases because there is only ever one of it.
 *
 * [DeepLinkManager] is the same capability behind an injectable type. Production code depends on
 * the interface; [DeepLinkManagerImpl] forwards to the singleton, and `FakeDeepLinkManager` gives
 * each test its own isolated instance.
 *
 * ## Using
 * ```kotlin
 * class NavCoordinator(private val links: DeepLinkManager, scope: CoroutineScope) {
 *     private val parser = deepLinkParser {
 *         route("/product/{id}") { ProductScreen(it["id"]!!) }
 *     }
 *
 *     init {
 *         scope.launch {
 *             links.incoming.collect { link -> parser.parse(link)?.let(::navigate) }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
