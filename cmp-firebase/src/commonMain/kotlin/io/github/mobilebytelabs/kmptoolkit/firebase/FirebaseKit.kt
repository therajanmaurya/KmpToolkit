/**
 * Single, in-library setup surface for Firebase across every KMP target —
 * **"setup stays in the library"**.
 *
 * [initialize] enables crash reporting and wires the platform [crashReporter]
 * in one idempotent call. What each platform needs:
 *
 * - **Android** — nothing to call. A `ContentProvider` (`FirebaseInitProvider`)
 *   runs [initialize] automatically at process start; Firebase auto-reads
 *   `google-services.json`. Zero app code.
 * - **iOS / macOS / tvOS** — call [initialize] once from your entry point. Native
 *   Firebase Crashlytics then auto-captures uncaught crashes.
 * - **JVM / JS / Linux / Windows / wasmJs** — [initialize] activates the
 *   structured logging [crashReporter]; route your exception handler to it.
 *
 * ### The only residual app-side steps (Firebase constraints, not library gaps)
 * These identify YOUR Firebase project, so Firebase itself requires them in the app:
 * - **Android**: add `google-services.json` + apply `com.google.gms.google-services`.
 * - **Apple**: add `GoogleService-Info.plist` and the one Swift line
 *   `FirebaseApp.configure()` in your `@main` `init` (GitLive's documented path).
 * - **JS**: pass your web config via `Firebase.initialize(options = FirebaseOptions(...))`.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * ```kotlin
 * // Non-Android entry point (Apple @main, desktop main(), JS bootstrap):
 * FirebaseKit.initialize()
 *
 * // Anywhere after init — rich, AI-feedable capture:
 * try { risky() } catch (t: Throwable) {
 *     FirebaseKit.crashReporter.recordException(t)
 * }
 * ```

     * Idempotent. Stashes [config] (so the Measurement-Protocol analytics factory
     * can auto-wire from it), initializes native Firebase for the running platform
     * where GitLive supports it, then installs the crash reporter. When this
     * platform has no options (and is not on the MP tier), analytics degrades to
     * NoOp with a WARN — it never throws (analytics must not break the app).
     *
     * **Apple caveat — this guarantee is not absolute on iOS/macOS/tvOS.** Apple's Firebase SDK
     * validates option *shape* inside `FirebaseApp.configure` and raises an Objective-C
     * `NSException` on malformed input, e.g. a mis-typed key:
     *
     * ```
     * [FirebaseInstallations][I-FIS008000] … `FirebaseOptions.APIKey` doesn't match the
     * expected format: API Key length must be 39 characters, API Key must start with `A`.
     * ```
     *
     * An ObjC `NSException` is not a Kotlin `Throwable`, so it cannot be caught here — it
     * terminates the process. Malformed Apple options are therefore a hard crash at startup,
     * not a graceful degradation. Supply the values exactly as the Firebase console issues
     * them. Verified by `ProgrammaticInitTest`, which runs this path on a real iOS simulator.
