 * Recording [CrashReporter] for tests — shipped in the main artifact.
 *
 * Error-handling paths are the ones most worth testing and the hardest to observe: the assertion
 * you want is "this failure was *reported*, and reported as non-fatal", which a no-op reporter
 * cannot tell you.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val crashes = FakeCrashReporter()
 * SyncWorker(crashes).run()          // network throws internally
 *
 * val recorded = crashes.recorded.single()
 * assertFalse(recorded.fatal, "a retryable sync failure must not be reported as fatal")
 * assertEquals("sync", recorded.extraKeys["stage"])
 * ```
 *
 * Breadcrumbs, custom keys and the user id are recorded separately, so a test can also assert that
 * **no PII** was attached:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * assertFalse(crashes.customKeys.values.any { it.contains("@") })
 * ```
