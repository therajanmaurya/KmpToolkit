/**
 * 2026 Android Built-in Intent (BII) mapping helper.
 *
 * Resolves an `AppIntentDef` to its `actions.intent.{NAME}` BII identifier, used by the
 * v0.4 candidate `generateShortcutsXml` Gradle task to emit `res/xml/cmp_app_intents_shortcuts.xml`
 * capability blocks consumer-side.
 *
 * Per SPIKE_FINDINGS_V0_3.md S0.B PIVOT verdict: BIIs (Built-in Intents in shortcuts.xml) are
 * the 2026-current canonical Android Assistant integration path — NOT the "Assistant Schema +
 * App Engagement APIs" approach v0.2 SPIKE_FINDINGS speculated. See developer.android.com/develop/devices/assistant/get-started.
 *
 * ADR-09 row: cmp-app-intents androidMain Gradle `generateShortcutsXml` task itself is deferred
 * to v0.4 Phase 4 polish — this `AssistantBii` helper ships now so consumers can call
 * `AssistantBii.resolveBii(def)` directly OR the v0.4 task can consume it.
