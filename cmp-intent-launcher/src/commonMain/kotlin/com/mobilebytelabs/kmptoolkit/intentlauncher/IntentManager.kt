package com.mobilebytelabs.kmptoolkit.intentlauncher

/**
 * Injectable entry point for launching system intents — the type to depend on from a ViewModel,
 * repository or composable.
 *
 * ## Why an interface when [IntentLauncher] already exists
 * [IntentLauncher] is an `expect class`, so code calling it directly cannot be substituted: no
 * fake in tests, no decorator for analytics or permission checks. [IntentManager] is the same
 * capability behind an injectable type, and it adds the [capabilities] probe that lets a caller
 * ask before it offers. [IntentLauncher] stays public and unchanged.
 *
 * ## Implementing
 * Only [capabilities] and [launch] are abstract; every other member derives from them, so a test
 * double is short:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class FakeIntentManager(
 *     override val capabilities: IntentCapabilities = IntentCapabilities.Full,
 * ) : IntentManager {
 *     override suspend fun launch(block: IntentBuilder.() -> Unit) = IntentResult.Cancelled
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Using
 * ```kotlin
 * class AvatarViewModel(private val intents: IntentManager) : ViewModel() {
 *     val canPick = intents.supports(IntentOperation.PickImage)
 *
 *     fun choose() = viewModelScope.launch {
 *         when (val r = intents.pickImage()) {
 *             is IntentResult.Ok -> setAvatar(r.data?.uri)
 *             is IntentResult.Cancelled -> Unit
 *             is IntentResult.Failed -> showError(r.cause)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

 *
 * ## The Android caveat, made honest
 * On Android [defaultIntentLauncher] returns `null`, because a launcher needs an Activity. Rather
 * than fail at the call site, [capabilities] **drops the picker operations** in that state and
 * keeps only the two that genuinely work without an Activity — `openAppSettings` and
 * `createDocument`, which the library's own `IntentLauncherInitProvider` and
 * `CreateDocumentProxyActivity` service. So `supports()` stays truthful and a UI hides pickers it
 * cannot run, instead of offering a button that fails once tapped.
 *
 * Pass a real launcher to get the full surface:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Android, inside a ComponentActivity
 * val manager = IntentManagerImpl(intentLauncher())
 *
 * // everywhere else — the default is already correct
 * val manager = IntentManagerImpl()
 * ```
